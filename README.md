### Irrigation Balance Monitoring System ###

### Purpose ###
* Combination of database data mining and measurements to determine ratio irrigation source (i.e., rainwater or pumped water).
* Convert existing SQL database into usable format. 

### Inputs ###
* Rain water gauges
* Ambient temperature
* Humidity
* Pressure
* Sunlight intensity
* Regional weather data
* Soil moisture
* misc. ag data 

### Outputs
* GSP overlay data 
* Rain Collection Data
* Temp. and humidity contour maps
* Site specific and field water balance at various time intervals
* Generate report on irrigation for farmer showing:
* Cost, monthly stats on balance, and targeted water volume/sq ft for plant type 


### Functions
*Simple user interface to visualize data, maps, and reports on water balance 

### Performance
*Reports generated once a day, data collected every hour, unless storm warning detected for county. 
### Cost ### 
* Rain gauge already provided 

### Power
* Less than 500 mW per unit during activity, < 250 mW while listening, and < 100 mW while sleeping 

### Size/weight
* 6" x 6" x 3" (for atmospheric measurement sensor system) and < 250 grams
